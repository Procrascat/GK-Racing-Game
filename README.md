# GK-Racing-Game
Still in development
- I am working from the book "Hands on Intro to Game Programming(http://gamkedo.com/how-to-program-games/)" by Chris Deleon(https://chrisdeleon.com/).
- Textures/images I used are not owned by me but are copyright free.
- This is one of many projects that I'm just using to learning programming.
